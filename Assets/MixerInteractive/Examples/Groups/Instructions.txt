Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example demonstrates how to use groups. Groups can be used to segment the audience
and show different controls to different people. For example, you could divide the audience into
teams. Or you can have groups of 1, where each participant controls a character and is shown
different controls based on which character they get to control.
